        //- You are also (given an integer k).
        //- An integer x is called (k-reducible)
        //  + if (performing the following operation) (at most k times) reduces (it to 1):
        //  + Replace x with (the count of set bits) in its binary representation.
        //  For example, the binary representation of 6 is "110".
        //  Applying the operation once reduces it to 2 (since "110" has two set bits).
        // Applying the operation again to 2 (binary "10") reduces it to 1 (since "10" has one set bit).
        //* Return an integer denoting (the number of positive integers) (less than n) that are k-reducible.
        //- Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo (10^9 + 7).
        //- (A set bit) refers to (a bit) in the binary representation of a number that has a value of 1.
