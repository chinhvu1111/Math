        //** Requirement
        //- You are given two strings, s and t.
        //- You can create a new string by selecting a substring from s (possibly empty)
        // and a substring from t (possibly empty), then concatenating them in order.
        //* Return the length of the longest palindrome that can be formed this way.
        //- A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
        //- A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.
        //
        // Idea
        //1
        //1.0,
        //- Method-1:
        //+ Constraints:
        //1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000
        //s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
        //  + Time: O(n^2)
        //
        //- Brainstorm
        //
        //
