        //** Requirement
        //- Given an integer array nums,
        //* (find the number of subsequences of size 5) of nums with (a unique middle mode).
        //- Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo (10^9 + 7).
        //- ("A mode" of a sequence of numbers) is defined as (the element) that appears (the maximum number of times) (in the sequence).
        //- A sequence of numbers contains (a unique mode) if it has only (one mode).
        //- A sequence of numbers seq of size 5 contains (a unique "middle mode") if the middle element (seq[2]) is (a unique mode).
        //- A subsequence is a non-empty array that can be derived from another array by (deleting some or no elements)
        // (without) changing (the order of "the remaining elements").
        //
        // Idea
        //1.
        //1.0,
        // Method-1:
        //- Constraint
        //5 <= nums.length <= 1000
        //-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
        //  + length<=1000
        //  + nums<=10^9 ==> Long / binary search
        //
        //- Brainstorm
        //
        //
