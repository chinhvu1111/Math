        //** Requirement
        //- You are given an array nums of (n positive integers).
        //You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:
        //- If the element is (even), divide it by 2.
        //  + For example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], then you can do this operation on (the last element), and the array will be [1,2,3,2].
        //- If the element is (odd), multiply it by 2.
        //  + For example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], then you can do this operation on (the first element), and the array will be [2,2,3,4].
        //- The (deviation of the array) is (the maximum difference) between (any two elements in the array).
        //* Return (the minimum deviation the array) can have after performing (some number of operations).
        //
        // Idea
        //1.
        //1.0,
        // Method-1:
        //- Constraint
        //n == nums.length
        //2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
        //1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
        //  + n khá lớn:
        //  Time: O(n*log(n))
        //
        //- Brainstorm
        //
        //- a<b
