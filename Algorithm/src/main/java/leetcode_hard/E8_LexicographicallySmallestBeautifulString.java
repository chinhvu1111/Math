        //** Requirement
        //- A string is (beautiful) if:
        //  + It consists of the (first k letters) of (the English lowercase alphabet).
        //  + It does (not contain) any (substring of length 2 or more) which is (a palindrome).
        //      + Without (the palindrome) with (length>=2)
        //
        //- You are given (a beautiful string s of length n) and (a positive integer k).
        //* Return (the lexicographically smallest string) of length n, which is (larger than) s and is beautiful.
        // If there is (no such string), return (("an empty") string).
        //- (A string a) is lexicographically larger than a string b (of the same length)
        // if in the first position where a and b differ,
        // a has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in b.
        //
        //- For example, "abcd" is lexicographically larger than "abcc" because the first position
        // they differ is at the fourth character, and d is greater than c.
        //
        //Example 1:
        //
        //Input: s = "abcz", k = 26
        //Output: "abda"
        //Explanation: The string "abda" is beautiful and lexicographically larger than the string "abcz".
        //It can be proven that there is no string that is lexicographically larger than the string "abcz",
        // beautiful, and lexicographically smaller than the string "abda".
        //
        //** Idea
        //1.
        //1.0,
        //- Method-1:
        //+ Constraints:
        //1 <= n == s.length <= 10^5
        //4 <= k <= 26
        //s is a beautiful string.
        //  + length <= 10^5 => Time: O(n)
        //
        //* Brainstorm:
        //Ex:
        //s = "aabdadecgga", (k=4 ==> abcd)
        //
        //1.1, Case
        //
        //
        //1.2, Optimization
        //
        //
    }
