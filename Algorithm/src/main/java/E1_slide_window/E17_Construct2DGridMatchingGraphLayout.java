        //- You are given a 2D integer array edges representing an undirected graph having n nodes,
        // where edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes an edge between nodes ui and vi.
        //- Construct a 2D grid that satisfies these conditions:
        //  + The grid contains all nodes from (0 to n - 1) in its cells, with each node appearing (exactly once).
        //  + Two nodes should be in adjacent grid cells (horizontally or vertically) if and only if there is an edge between them in edges.
        //- It is guaranteed that edges can form a 2D grid that satisfies the conditions.
        //* Return a 2D integer array satisfying the conditions above. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.
