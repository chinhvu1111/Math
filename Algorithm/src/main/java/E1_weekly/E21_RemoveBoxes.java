        //** Requirement
        //- You are given several boxes with different colors represented by different positive numbers.
        //- You may experience several rounds to remove boxes until there is no box left.
        //- Each time you can choose some continuous boxes with the same color (i.e., composed of k boxes, k >= 1),
        // remove them and get k * k points.
        //* Return the maximum points you can get.
        //
        //** Idea
        //1.
        //1.0,
        // Method-1:
        //- Constraint
        //1 <= boxes.length <= 100
        //1 <= boxes[i] <= 100
        //
        //- Brainstorm
        //
        //
