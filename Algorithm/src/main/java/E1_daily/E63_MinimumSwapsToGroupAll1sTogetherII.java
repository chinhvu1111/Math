        //- (A circular array) is defined as an array
        //  + where we consider (the first element) and the (last element) to be (adjacent).
        //- Given (a binary circular array nums),
        //* Return (the minimum number of swaps) required to (group all 1's) present in the array (together) at any location.

        //** Idea
        //1.
        //1.0,
        //* Method-1:
        //- Constraint
        //1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
        //nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
