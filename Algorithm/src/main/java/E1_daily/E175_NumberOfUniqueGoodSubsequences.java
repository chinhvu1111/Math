        //- You are given (a binary string binary).
        //- (A subsequence of binary) is considered good if it is not empty and has no leading zeros (with the exception of "0").
        //- Find the number of unique good subsequences of binary.
        //  + For example, if binary = "001", then all the good subsequences are ["0", "0", "1"], so the unique good subsequences are "0" and "1".
        //  Note that subsequences "00", "01", and "001" are not good because they have leading zeros.
        //* Return the number of unique good subsequences of binary. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
        //
        //- A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some
        // or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
        //

        //- Method-1:
        //Constraints:
        //1 <= binary.length <= 10^5
        //binary consists of only '0's and '1's.
