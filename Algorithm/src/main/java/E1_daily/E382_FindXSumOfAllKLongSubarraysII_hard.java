        //** Requirement
        //- You are given an array nums of n integers and two integers k and x.
        //- The x-sum of an array is calculated by the following procedure:
        //  + Count the occurrences of all elements in the array.
        //  + Keep only the occurrences of the top x most frequent elements.
        //  If two elements have the same number of occurrences,
        //  the element with the bigger value is considered more frequent.
        //  + Calculate the sum of the resulting array.
        //* Note that if an array has less than x distinct elements, its x-sum is the sum of the array.
        //* Return an integer array answer of length n - k + 1 where answer[i] is the x-sum of the subarray nums[i..i + k - 1].
        //
        //** Idea
        //1.
        //1.0,
        //- Method-1:
        //+ Constraints:
        //nums.length == n
        //1 <= n <= 10^5
        //1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
        //1 <= x <= k <= nums.length
        //
        //* Brainstorm:
        //
        //
        //1.1, Case
        //
        //1.2, Optimization
        //
        //1.3, Complexity
        //- Time: O(n)
        //
        //- Space: O(1)
        //
