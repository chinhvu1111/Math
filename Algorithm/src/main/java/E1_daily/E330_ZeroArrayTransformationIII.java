        //** Requirement
        //- You are given an integer array nums of length n and a 2D array queries where queries[i] = [li, ri].
        //- Each queries[i] represents (the following action) on nums:
        //  + Decrement the value at each index in the range [li, ri] in nums by (at most 1).
        //  + The amount by which the value is (decremented) can be chosen (independently) for each index.
        //- A Zero Array is an array with all its elements (equal to 0).
        //
        //* Return (the maximum number of elements) that can be removed from queries,
        // such that nums can still be converted to a zero array using the remaining queries.
        //- If it is not possible to convert nums to a zero array, return -1.
        //
        //Example 1:
        //Input: nums = [2,0,2], queries = [[0,2],[0,2],[1,1]]
        //
        //Output: 1
        //
        //Explanation:
        //
        //After removing queries[2], nums can still be converted to a zero array.
        //
        //Using queries[0], decrement nums[0] and nums[2] by 1 and nums[1] by 0.
        //Using queries[1], decrement nums[0] and nums[2] by 1 and nums[1] by 0.
        //
        //** Idea
        //1.
        //1.0,
        //- Method-1:
        //+ Constraints:
        //1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
        //0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
        //1 <= queries.length <= 10^5
        //queries[i].length == 2
        //0 <= li <= ri < nums.length
        //
        //* Brainstorm:
        //
        //
        //
        //1.1, Case
        //
        //
        //1.2, Optimization
        //
        //
        //1.3, Complexity
        //- Space: O(n)
        //- Time: O(n)
        //
