        //- You are given a string s and an integer k.
        //- Your task is to find the maximum difference between the frequency of two characters, freq[a] - freq[b],
        // in a substring subs of s, such that:
        //  + subs has a size of (at least k).
        //  + Character a has an odd frequency in subs.
        //  + Character b has an even frequency in subs.
        //* Return the maximum difference.
        //- Note that subs can contain more than 2 distinct characters.
