Table: SurveyLog

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| action      | ENUM |
| question_id | int  |
| answer_id   | int  |
| q_num       | int  |
| timestamp   | int  |
+-------------+------+

There is no primary key for this table. It may contain duplicates.
action is an ENUM of the type: "show", "answer", or "skip".
Each row of this table indicates the user with ID = id has taken an action with the question (question_id) at time timestamp.
+ If the action taken by the user is "answer", answer_id will contain the id of that answer, otherwise, it will be null.
+ q_num is the numeral order of the question in the current session.


+ The (answer rate) for a question is the number of times (a user answered the question) by (chia) the number of times (a user showed the question).
- Write an SQL query to report the question that has the highest answer rate.
+ If multiple questions have the same maximum answer rate, report the question with the smallest (question_id).

** Bài này tư duy như sau:
** Solution-1:
- Group question_id và count(if(answer is not null,1,0)) ==> tìm ra số câu trả lời của mỗi question.
- order by num desc, question_id asc ==> rn=1 (Để chọn)
======
Select question_id as survey_log from
(
  Select question_id, row_number() over(order by num desc, question_id asc) as rn from
(
  Select question_id, sum(if(answer_id is not null, 1, 0)) as num
  from SurveyLog s group by question_id
) a ) b where b.rn=1;

** Solution-2:
- Ngoài ra ta có thể tính :
answer rate = a user answered the question) / the number of times (a user showed the question)
======
SELECT  question_id as survey_log
FROM SurveyLog
GROUP BY question_id
ORDER BY ( count(answer_id) / count(case when action = 'show' then question_id ELSE null end ) ) desc, 1 asc
LIMIT 1
