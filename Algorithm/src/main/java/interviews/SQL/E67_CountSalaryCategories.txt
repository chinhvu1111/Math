** Requirement:
- Report number of banks for each salary category:
+ "Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
+ "Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
+ "High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.


** Idea
1.
1.1, Idea
- Simply, we just use case when with income --> categorize first.
- Group by category + sum()
- Using union to build all category table
- After that, we will do left join operation on that.

* Method-1:

With cte1 as(
Select
    case
        when income<20000 then 'Low Salary'
        when income>50000 then 'High Salary'
        else 'Average Salary'
    end as category
from Accounts
),
cte2 as(
Select category, count(1) as accounts_count from cte1 group by category
),
cte3 as(
Select 'Low Salary' as category
UNION
Select 'Average Salary' as category
UNION
Select 'High Salary' as category
),
cte4 as(
Select
    c3.category, ifnull(c2.accounts_count, 0) as accounts_count
from cte3 c3 left join cte2 c2 on c2.category=c3.category
)
Select * from cte4;

* Method-2:
- We will build all column category based on the income value.
- Format:
Select 'x' as category, SUM(if()) from Accounts.

with cte1 as(
  Select
    'Low Salary' as category, SUM(if(income<20000, 1, 0)) as accounts_count
  from Accounts
  UNION
  Select
    'Average Salary' as category, SUM(if(income>=20000 and income<50000, 1, 0)) as accounts_count
  from Accounts
  UNION
  Select
    'High Salary' as category, SUM(if(income>50000, 1, 0)) as accounts_count
  from Accounts
)
Select * from cte1;
