** Requirement:
- Write an SQL query that reports for
 + (each user) (the product id) on which the user (spent the most money).
In case the same user spent the most money on two or more products, (report all of them).

** Idea
1.
1.0, Idea
- We need to group by  product_id | user_id | quantity --> It has many cases of having different sales
- Calculate the money which each user spent on each product.
- After that, we will dense_rank() --> order by money

with cte1 as(
Select
    product_id, user_id, sum(quantity) as quantity
from Sales group by product_id, user_id
),
cte2 as(
Select
    user_id,
    c1.product_id,
    (c1.quantity * p.price) as amount_money
from cte1 c1 join Product p
on c1.product_id = p.product_id
),
cte3 as(
Select
    user_id,
    product_id,
    dense_rank() over (partition by user_id order by amount_money desc) as rn
from cte2
),
cte4 as(
Select
    user_id,
    product_id
from cte3 where rn=1
)

Select * from cte4;

* Refactor:
with cte1 as(
Select
    product_id, user_id, sum(quantity) as quantity
from Sales group by product_id, user_id
),
cte2 as(
Select
    user_id,
    c1.product_id,
    dense_rank() over (partition by user_id order by (c1.quantity * p.price) desc) as rn
from cte1 c1 join Product p
on c1.product_id = p.product_id
),
cte3 as(
Select
    user_id,
    product_id
from cte2 where rn=1
)
Select * from cte3;
