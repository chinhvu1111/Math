** Đề bài:
- Report thống kê của mỗi team như sau:
+ team_name, matches_played, points, goal_for, goal_diff = (goal_against, goal_for - goal_against)

** Tư duy
1.
1.1, Idea
- Vì 1 đội có thể chỉ đá (sân nhà/ sân khách)
--> Ta sẽ lấy Teams table join sang Matches sau đó group by theo team_id (Teams table)
- Sau đó nếu (t.team_id==home_team_id) --> Tính cho sân nhà <> tính cho sân khách.

1.2, Lỗi hơi nhầm 1 chút điều kiện ở chỗ:
if(t.team_id=m.home_team_id, home_team_goals, away_team_goals) as goal_for,
if(t.team_id=m.away_team_id, home_team_goals, away_team_goals) as goal_against,
- Hiểu đơn giản là mỗi row có:
+ goal_for, goal_against
if (team_id=home_team_id) :
    + goal_for= home_team_goals
    + goal_against= away_team_goals
    ==> Nó đi cả đôi
<> thì ngược lại thôi.
==> Không phải là kiểu ntn (ĐẢO SAI)
if(t.team_id=m.home_team_id, home_team_goals, away_team_goals) as goal_for,
if(t.team_id=m.away_team_id, away_team_goals, home_team_goals) as goal_against,
==> SAI


* Method-1:

with cte1 as(
Select
t.team_name,
t.team_id,
# m.home_team_id,
# m.away_team_id,
if(t.team_id=m.home_team_id, home_team_goals, away_team_goals) as goal_for,
if(t.team_id=m.away_team_id, home_team_goals, away_team_goals) as goal_against,
# home_team_goals,
# away_team_goals,
case
    when t.team_id=m.home_team_id then if(home_team_goals>away_team_goals, 3, if(home_team_goals=away_team_goals, 1, 0))
    when t.team_id=m.away_team_id then if(home_team_goals<away_team_goals, 3, if(home_team_goals=away_team_goals, 1, 0))
    # else 0
end as points
from
Teams t join Matches m
on t.team_id=m.home_team_id or t.team_id=m.away_team_id
),
cte2 as(
Select
    team_name,
    count(1) as matches_played,
    sum(points) as points,
    sum(goal_for) as goal_for,
    sum(goal_against) as goal_against,
    sum(goal_for-goal_against) as goal_diff
from cte1 c1
group by c1.team_id, c1.team_name
)
Select * from cte2
order by points desc, goal_diff desc, team_name;

* Method-2:
- Cách này đơn giản là tách columns trước + (group trước trên 1 table) + join sau
- Cách này sẽ bỏ qua các đội k đá trận nào.

** Chú ý:
- Khi tách column : thì cần phải UNION ALL
--> như bên dưới nêú không union all ==> Thiếu cases

with cte1 as(
Select
home_team_id as team_id,
away_team_id as opponent_id,
home_team_goals as goal_for,
away_team_goals as goal_against,
if(home_team_goals>away_team_goals, 3, if(home_team_goals=away_team_goals, 1, 0)) as points
from Matches t
UNION ALL
Select
away_team_id as team_id,
home_team_id as opponent_id,
away_team_goals as goal_for,
home_team_goals as goal_against,
if(home_team_goals<away_team_goals, 3, if(home_team_goals=away_team_goals, 1, 0)) as points
from Matches t
),
cte2 as(
Select
     team_id,
     count(1) as matches_played,
     sum(points) as points,
     sum(goal_for) as goal_for,
     sum(goal_against) as goal_against
from cte1
group by team_id
),
cte3 as(
Select
     m.team_name,
     matches_played,
     points,
     goal_for,
     goal_against,
     (goal_for-goal_against) as goal_diff
from cte2 c2 join Teams m on c2.team_id=m.team_id
)

Select * from cte3
order by points desc, goal_diff desc, team_name;

* Tối ưu:
- Hạn chế group by ==> Tránh hash
- Trong spark ==> Tránh shuffle
- Như bến dưới ==> Việc (group by xong --> Join)
<> sẽ slow hơn việc join --> group by 1 lần

)

Select * from cte2
order by points desc, goal_diff desc, team_name;
