+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.
If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.
No employee will be the manager of themself.
- Write an SQL query to report the managers with at least five direct reports.

Select b.name from
(Select managerId from Employee group by managerId having count(1)>=5) a
join
(Select * from Employee) b
on a.managerId=b.id;
