1.1, Idea

* Method-1:

- Lag (Views row after current row) + partition by user_id order by purchase_date
+ Với những trường hợp mà chỉ có 1 order --> lag(purchase_date, 1, 0)
- Filter all rows <= 7 days
- DATE_DIFF(date1, date2) = date2 - date1.

with cte1 as(
Select
    user_id,
    purchase_id,
    DATEDIFF(lag(purchase_date, 1, 0) over (partition by user_id order by purchase_date desc) ,purchase_date) as date_diff
from Purchases
),
cte2 as(
Select
distinct user_id
from cte1 c1 where date_diff<=7
)
Select * from cte2;

* Method-2:
- Dùng phép join --> Slower rất nhiều.
select distinct p1.user_id
from purchases p1
inner join
purchases p2
on p1.user_id=p2.user_id and p1.purchase_id<>p2.purchase_id
and abs(datediff(p1.purchase_date, p2.purchase_date))<=7
order by p1.user_id
