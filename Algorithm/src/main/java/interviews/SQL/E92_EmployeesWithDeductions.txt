** Requirement:
- In a company, each employee must work a certain number of hours every month. Employees work in sessions.
The number of hours an employee worked can be calculated from the sum of the number of minutes the employee worked in all of their sessions.
The number of minutes in each session is rounded up.

For example, if the employee worked for 51 minutes and 2 seconds in a session, we consider it 52 minutes.
Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the employees that will be deducted.
In other words, report the IDs of the employees that did not work the needed hours.

* Method-1:
- Cần làm tròn số minutes mỗi session trước --> Sau đó sum lại
- Nếu muốn làm tròn --> Thì có thể đổi ra second sau đó ceil(/ 60)
timestampdiff(second, "2009-09-18 00:00:00", "2009-10-17 00:00:00");
timestampdiff(minute, "2009-09-18 00:00:00", "2009-10-17 00:00:00");
- Group by employee_id + sum(TIMESTAMPDIFF(out_time - in_time))
- Sau đó join + filter.

* Method-1:

with cte1 as(
Select employee_id, timestampdiff(second, in_time, out_time) as second_work_time from Logs
),
cte2 as(
Select
    e.employee_id,
    e.needed_hours,
    sum(ceil(ifnull(second_work_time, 0)/60)) as work_time from
Employees e left join cte1 c1
on e.employee_id=c1.employee_id
group by e.employee_id, e.needed_hours
),
cte3 as(
Select employee_id from cte2 c2 where c2.work_time < c2.needed_hours * 60
)
Select * from cte3;
