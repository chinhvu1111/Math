** Requirement:
- Divide the employees team:
+ >=2 two member each team
+ All member have the same salary each team
+ If an employee has an unique salary --> not assigned
+ Team's id based on the rank of salary
Ex:
 team_id = 1 --> lowest salary

** Idea
1.
1.1, Idea
- We need to filter all salary such that count(1) =1
- We just need to partition by (salary) + dense_rank() over(order by employee_id)
- We just need to get data having team_id<=2.

with cte1 as(
Select distinct salary from Employees group by salary having count(1)>1
),
cte2 as(
Select
    employee_id,
    name,
    salary,
    dense_rank() over(order by salary) as team_id
from Employees where salary in (Select * from cte1)
)

Select * from cte2 order by team_id, employee_id;

* Tối ưu:
- Bỏ distinct đi --> Vì không cần thiết.
