** Solution-1:
- Ngoài việc sum(if(student_id is null, 0, 1)) ==> Ta có thể count(student_id) cũng được.
Select dept_name, sum(if(student_id is null, 0, 1)) as student_number
from Department d left join Student s on d.dept_id=s.dept_id
group by d.dept_id, dept_name order by sum(if(student_id is null, 0, 1)) desc, dept_name;

GROUP BY dept_name
ORDER BY student_number DESC,dept_name;
