with cte1 as(
Select event_type, avg(occurences) as occurences from Events group by event_type
),
cte2 as(
Select business_id, event_type, sum(occurences) as occurences from Events group by business_id, event_type
),
cte3 as(
Select c2.business_id, c1.event_type from cte2 c2 left join cte1 c1 on c1.event_type = c2.event_type where c2.occurences>c1.occurences
),
cte4 as(
