** Requirement:
- Write an SQL query to report all the orders based on the following:
+ If a customer has at least one order of type 0, do not report any order of type 1 from that customer.
+ Otherwise, report all the orders of the customer.

** Idea
1.
1.1,
- Filter the customer having at least 1 order of type 0.
- Rest of them --> report all

* Method-1:

with cte1 as(
Select
    distinct(customer_id) as customer_id
from Orders where order_type=0
),
cte2 as(
Select o.*
from Orders o where o.customer_id in (Select customer_id from cte1) and order_type=0
),
cte3 as(
Select o.*
from Orders o where o.customer_id not in (Select customer_id from cte1)
),
cte4 as(
Select * from cte2
UNION
Select * from cte3
)
Select * from cte4;

* Method-2:
- Summarize the subject:
+ We want to list all order having order_type = (0/1)
+ We just need to map customer_id to (type) / Each order
    + Of course, customer_id also distincted
    + Group by customer_id
+ After that, we will apply in operator.

with cte1 as(
Select
    customer_id, min(order_type) as order_type
from Orders group by customer_id
),
cte2 as(
Select * from Orders
where (customer_id, order_type) in (Select * from cte1)
)
Select * from cte2;
