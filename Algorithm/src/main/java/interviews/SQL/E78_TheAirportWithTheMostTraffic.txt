** Requirement:
- Report the ID of the airport with the most traffic
- The airport with the most traffic:
+ The airport has the largest total number of flights that either (departed from) or (arrived at the airport) (Tính theo tổng số chuyến bay)
- If there is more than one airport with the most traffic, report them all.

** Idea
1.
1.1,
-  This problem --> tách columns
+ departure_airport --> airport
+ arrival_airport   --> airport
+ Union all

* Method-1:

with cte1 as(
Select departure_airport as airport, flights_count from Flights
UNION ALL
Select arrival_airport as airport, flights_count from Flights
),
cte2 as(
Select
airport,
sum(flights_count) as flights_count
from cte1
group by airport
),
cte3 as(
Select
    a.airport as airport_id
from
(
    Select
        airport,
        flights_count,
        dense_rank() over(order by flights_count desc) as rn
    from cte2
)a where a.rn=1
)
Select * from cte3;

* Method-2:
- Thay vì dùng row_number() ở đây ta dùng select max.

total_flights = (select max(total_flights) from agg)
