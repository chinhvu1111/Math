** Requirement:
- Write an SQL query that reports the rank of each student in their department as a percentage,
where the rank as a percentage is computed using the following formula:
+ (student_rank_in_the_department - 1) * 100 / (the_number_of_students_in_the_department - 1).
The percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
student_rank_in_the_department is determined by (descending mark),
such that the student with the highest mark is rank 1. If two students get the same mark, they also get the same rank.

** Idea

1.0, Idea
* Method-1:

- Count the number of students for each department
- Students left join the table above
==> Đoạn trên có thể bỏ đi được --> nếu dùng count() over( partition by department_id)
- dense_rank() over(partition by department_id order by mark)

with cte1 as(
Select
    student_id, department_id,
    count(1) over(partition by department_id) as num_student,
    rank() over(partition by department_id order by mark desc) as rn
from Students
),
cte2 as(
Select
    student_id, department_id,
    round(if(num_student=1, 0, (rn-1)*100 / (num_student-1)), 2) as percentage
from cte1
)
Select * from cte2;

* Method-2:
- Using percent_rank()
SELECT student_id, department_id,
    ROUND(100*PERCENT_RANK() OVER (
          PARTITION BY department_id
          ORDER BY mark DESC)
    , 2) AS percentage
FROM Students
