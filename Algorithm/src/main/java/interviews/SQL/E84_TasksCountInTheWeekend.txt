** Requirement:
- Write an SQL query to report:
+ The number of the tasks that were submitted during the [weekend] (Saturday, Sunday) as (weekend_cnt), and
+ The number of the tasks that were submitted during the [working days] as (working_cnt).

** Idea
1.
1.1, Idea
- Using WEEKDAY(date) to get current weekday.
Note: 0 = Monday, 1 = Tuesday, 2 = Wednesday, 3 = Thursday, 4 = Friday, 5 = Saturday, 6 = Sunday.
- In the same, we will calculate (the number of total of rows), (the number of rows submitted on weekend).

* Method-1:

with cte1 as(
Select
    count(1) as cnt, sum(if(weekday(submit_date) >=5, 1, 0)) as weekend_cnt
from Tasks
),
cte2 as(
Select
    weekend_cnt,
    (cnt - weekend_cnt) as working_cnt
from cte1
)
Select * from cte2;

* Refactor:
SELECT
COUNT(IF(WEEKDAY(submit_date) IN (5, 6), submit_date, NULL)) AS weekend_cnt,
COUNT(IF(WEEKDAY(submit_date) NOT IN (5, 6), submit_date, NULL)) AS working_cnt
FROM Tasks;
