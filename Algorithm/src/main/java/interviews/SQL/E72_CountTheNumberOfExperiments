** Requirment:
- Với mỗi platform thống kê số lượng các experiment về 3 experiment_names (Reading, Sports, Programming)

** Idea
1.
1.1,
- Dùng phép group by platform, experiment_name
- Thiếu experiment_name nào thì dùng union đủ 3 giá trị vào là được.

# Write your MySQL query statement below

with cte1 as(
Select
     platform, experiment_name,
     count(1) as num_experiments
from Experiments
group by platform, experiment_name
),
cte2 as(
Select
    'Programming' as experiment_name
UNION
Select
    'Sports' as experiment_name
UNION
Select
    'Reading' as experiment_name

cte3 as(

UNION
Select

UNION
Select

cte4 as(
     Select * from cte2 c3 join cte3 c4
