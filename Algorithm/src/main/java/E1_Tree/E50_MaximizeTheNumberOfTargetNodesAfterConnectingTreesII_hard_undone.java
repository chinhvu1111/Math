        //- There exist two undirected trees with n and m nodes, labeled from [0, n - 1] and [0, m - 1], respectively.
        //- You are given two 2D (integer arrays edges1 and edges2 of lengths n - 1 and m - 1), respectively,
        // where edges1[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that
        //  + there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the first tree and edges2[i] = [ui, vi]
        // indicates
        //  + that there is an edge between nodes ui and vi in the second tree.
        //- Node u is (target) to node v if (the number of edges) on the path from (u to v) is (even).
        //- Note that a node is always (target to itself).
        //* Return an array of n integers answer,
        // where answer[i] is (the maximum possible number of nodes) that are target to (node i) of (the first tree)
        //  + if you had to connect one node from (the first tree) to (another node) in (the second tree).
        //* Note that queries are (independent) from each other.
        // That is, for every query you will (remove the added edge) before proceeding to (the next query).
        //
        // Idea
        //1.
